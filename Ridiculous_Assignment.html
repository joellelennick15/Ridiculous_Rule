<h1>Most Ridiculous Rule</h1>

<p>When I was younger my parents made me study and do homework in the kitchen. They thought I would cheat if I did it in the office where the computer was.</p>

<h2> Why It's Ridiculous </h2>
<p> Even if I did want to cheat, it wouldn't matter becuase it was only homework. I could've also used the computer to look up a question I didn't understand.
